### About

- In early 2017 I was studying photography in London whilst working on the side. I published a Squarespace website as a personal portfolio for my portrait photography. I kept the site for 7 years until I deactivated it in early 2023.
- Squarespace as a platform is a great way to show of visually creative content and my site always "looked nice". When I pivoted to coding and began my bachelors in late 2020 the site was no longer useful. I kept the site for a few years for sentimental reasons and I tried to post coding related content on the site. However, LinkedIn and GitHub are much more effective and they are free.
