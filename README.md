# Squarespace-Personal-Website

### About

- In early 2017 I was studying photography in London, I published a Squarespace website as a personal portfolio.
- I kept the site for 7 years until I deactivated it in early 2024.
- I experimented with different content and styles.
- The final version was a clear, consise and high-key. The screen shots below show the different pages.
